## About Paparazzi
Paparazzi specializes in comprehensive website documentation through high-quality screenshot capture, addressing the specific needs of users who require complete visual records of web content beyond what standard screen capture tools provide. Unlike basic screenshot utilities that only capture visible content, Paparazzi intelligently navigates web pages to document their full extent, including content that requires scrolling or dynamic loading. This capability is particularly valuable for professionals who need to archive web content, compare website versions, document online evidence, or create visual references of web interfaces for various purposes.

The application distinguishes itself through its focus on web-specific capture scenarios and its ability to handle modern web technologies. It can capture content rendered with JavaScript, wait for dynamic elements to load, and adjust to different viewport sizes to simulate how websites appear on various devices. The scheduling functionality allows for regular documentation of changing web content, while the export options provide flexibility in how captured images are saved and organized. This combination of web-specific intelligence, automation capabilities, and output flexibility makes Paparazzi particularly valuable for UX designers documenting interface states, legal professionals preserving online evidence, researchers archiving web content, quality assurance teams testing website appearance, and content creators building visual references from web materials.
